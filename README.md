A project's file structure can be difficult to maintain. Especially when everything always ends up clumped together and permanetly saved to the Desktop and Downloads folder.

`CopyKat` is a localized project management system, kaban board, and timesheet built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) that helps freelancers organize their desktop and streamline mundane tasks.

## Features

### Project list

Since we're primarily dealing with local files, it's important to understand that `Projects` are just regular system folders. `Projects` are organized at a top level grid list which can be sorted by `name`, `status`, or even `client`. One major difference between `Projects` and system folders is that they contain files and folders (or references to them)

### Project templates

`Projects` can be copied into `Templates` which allow users to customize a structure that fits a particular workflow. `Templates` that help generate common folder structures and can copy files and name them according to the `Project` name.

### Copy template files

Simply define what files a particular `Template`
